	MePersonality presents a distributed multi-agent collaborative personalisation platform.
	Since the main purpose is to enable personalisation of browsed web content to user,
	MePersonality provides an interface for user interests model access.
	Via personalisation extensions, user can extend this model even further
	and based on gathered information about user interests and behaviour,
	user can modify content of browsed web pages to work more efficiently and comfortably.

	<h2 id='personalisation extensions'>Personalisation extensions</h2>
	Personalisation extensions are basically pieces of JavaScript code
	which can personalise the web browsing according to user needs.
	Besides basic functionality of JavaScript language,
	MePersonality provides wider possibilities within personalisation extensions including:
	<ul>
		<li>Built-in support of jQuery framework</li>
		<li>Use of other external JavaScript files, e.g. another third-party library</li>
		<li>Cross-origin requests</li>
		<li>Access to user browsing history</li>
		<li>Persistent storage via database API</li>
		<li>Personalisation API</li>
		<li>Communication API</li>
	</ul>
	This functionality is contained in a simple and fully asynchronous API
	which contributes to better user experience
	and more comfortable development of high-quality personalisation extensions.
	Moreover, this platform is aimed to be independent of contained web browser,
	so that developer does not need to concern about any compatibility issues
	and is able to focus on the main work goal - the personalisation.

	<h2 id='databaseAPI'>Database API</h2>
	Database API provides a unified interface to access the database (one of the advantages of our solution),
	so that developers need not worry about what type of database is currently implemented in the browser.
	Each extension has its own database, so different extensions do not limit each other.
	The database API currently exposes the following interface:
	<p>
	<table class='APItable'>
		<tbody>
			<tr class='firstRow'>
				<td>Method</td>
				<td>Description</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>clear()</td>
				<td>Deletes all records from the database.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>get()</td>
				<td>Returns a record with specified key.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>set()</td>
				<td>Sets the value of the record with specified key to a given value.
					This value can be of any JavaScript type that can be converted to a JSON string.
					If the key is already present in the database before insertion, its value is updated,
					otherwise the key is created and its value is adjusted
					according to the value specified as a parameter to this function.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>remove()</td>
				<td>Removes record with the given key from the database.
					If no such key exists in the database, nothing changes.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	</p>

	<h2 id='personalisationAPI'>Personalisation API</h2>
	Personalization API enables access to all user information we have obtained
	within the user interest modelling process.
	It provides the following functionality:
	<p>
	<table class='APItable'>
		<tbody>
			<tr class='firstRow'>
				<td>Method</td>
				<td>Description</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>getUrlsByTag()</td>
				<td>Returns URL list sorted by the relevancy of given tag.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>getTagsByUrl()</td>
				<td>Returns weighted tag list for given URL address.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>getDomains()</td>
				<td>Returns domain list sorted by the visit count.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>getUserTags()</td>
				<td>Returns weighted list of tags with the highest relevancy
					within the whole user model (global user interests).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>getUserTagsByDomain()</td>
				<td>Returns weighted list of tags with the highest relevancy
					within the given domain (local user interests).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>getTagRelevancy()</td>
				<td>Returns relevancy of given tag.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>getUrlTitle()</td>
				<td>Returns title for given URL.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>getVisitCount()</td>
				<td>Returns visit count of given URL.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	</p>

	<h2 id='communicationAPI'>Communication API</h2>
	Communication API enables communication among multiple instances of personalisation extension.
	It provides the following functionality:
	<p>
	<table class='APItable'>
		<tbody>
			<tr class='firstRow'>
				<td>Method</td>
				<td>Description</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>createUserCharacteristics()</td>
				<td>To be implemented soon.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class='functionName'>connect()</td>
				<td>Connects to the specified communication channel and returns a WebSocket object.
					Please see the WebSocket API reference for more details on how to work with it.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	</p>
